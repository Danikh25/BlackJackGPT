## Blackjack Rules

The game follows standard Blackjack rules, including:
- Players aim to get a hand total closer to 21 than the dealer without exceeding it.
- Number cards are worth their face value, face cards (Jacks, Queens, and Kings) are worth 10, and Aces can be worth 1 or 11.
- Blackjack is a hand containing an Ace and a 10-point card, and it beats all other hands except for another Blackjack, which results in a push.
- Players can choose to hit (take another card), stand (keep their current hand), double down (double their bet and take one more card), or split (divide their paired cards into two separate hands).
